Paper 1 applied and extended an existing modeling framework to a new problem domain.
# OR Taxonomy

- **Optimization Models**
  - Broad category of models seeking to maximize or minimize an objective subject to constraints.
  
  - **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)**
    - Linear objective and constraints
    - Some variables are integer (often binary)
    - Used for yes/no decisions, e.g., opening facilities, assigning customers
    
    - **Facility Location Models**
      - Main decisions: where to locate facilities (deployment)
      - Sometimes includes allocation of demand points to facilities
    
      - **Location–Allocation Models**
        - Explicitly includes customer/facility assignment variables
        - Examples: p-median, capacitated location–allocation, covering models
        - Structure used in Stage 1 of Arslan, Klibi & Montreuil (2021)
